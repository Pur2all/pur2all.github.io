Hi, I'm Francesco! I'm a Ph.D. student of the [Crypto group](https://crypto.dmi.unict.it/) at [University of Catania](www.unict.it). 
I am supervised by [Dario Catalano](http://www.dmi.unict.it/catalano/).

My research interests are (for now) mostly related to theoretical aspects of cryptography and
public key cryptography with advanced functionalities. 
You can find a list of my works on my [publications page](/publications/).

I obtained both my master's and bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [University of Salerno](www.unisa.it). 
My studies were focused mostly on Cryptography, Information Theory and theoretical foundations of Computer Science, like computability theory and complexity theory.

See my [CV](/cv/) for more details.
